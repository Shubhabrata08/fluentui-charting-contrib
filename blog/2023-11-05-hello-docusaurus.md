### Good data visualization transforms raw data into a visual form that is interpretable, delightful, and triggers insight.
 
As an industry leader with a comprehensive portfolio of data-driven products, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to distill the best standards, research, tools, and techniques into a data visualization toolkit that is truly One Microsoft. The goal of our new charting library is to produce a consistent and inclusive experience for customers across our platforms.
